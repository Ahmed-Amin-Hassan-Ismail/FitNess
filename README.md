# FitNess
 FitNess is the premier fitness-coaching app based on the “Loch Ness” workout. Users have to outrun, outswim or outclimb Nessie, the fitness monster. The goal of the app is to motivate user movement by having them outpace Nessie. If they fail, their avatar gets eaten.

 # Unit Test 
 
## Red-Green-Refactor

The name of the game in TDD is red, green, refactor. This means iteratively writing tests in this fashion:
1. Write a test that fails (red).
2. Write the minimum amount of code so the test passes (green).
3. Clean up test(s) and code as needed (refactor).
4. Repeat the process until all the logic cases are covered.
